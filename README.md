## Overview 📖
A 'first person shooter' technical demonstration which utilises many different aspects of Unreal Engine 4. It is coded primarily in C++, but blueprints is also used when needed. This project was created as part of my 'Game Engine Programming' module at University where I had to build a game with a single level and incorporate systems such as custom weapons, an ability and pickups which affect the character.
