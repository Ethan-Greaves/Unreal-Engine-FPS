## Overview 📖
A 'first person shooter' technical demonstration which utilises many different aspects of Unreal Engine 4. It is coded primarily in C++, but blueprints is also used when needed. This project was created as part of my 'Game Engine Programming' module at University where I had to build a game with a single level and incorporate systems such as custom weapons, an ability and pickups which affect the character.

## Technologies & Features 👨‍💻
* An inventory system whereby the player can pick up and equip guns
* A sprinting ability
* A graphical UI which displays stamina, health and score
* Enemies which charge at and shoot the player
* Hitscan and projectile based weapons
* A pickup system
